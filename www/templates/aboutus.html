      It's easy to take small steps to reduce your environmental impact - starting
      with reducing the consumption of goods! This app will help you find a new home
      for the things you no longer need, and save them from being thrown away.

    </div>
    <div class="item item-body">
      The app was conceived and developed for LSBU's staff and students. The name elephant was chosen because elephants live in harmony with their natural environment, and in doing so help preserve and protect it.
